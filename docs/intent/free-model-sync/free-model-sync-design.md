# Free Model Sync Design

## Context

Paid already treats free models as first-class `LlmModel` rows and exposes
them through free-policy direct-outbound runners (`model_policy: "free"`;
RDR-065, #3671). What is missing is the catalog ingestion path: the
application must fetch OpenRouter's live free-model list, classify the
models into Paid's existing tier semantics, and keep the catalog current as
models appear, expire, or disappear.

This segment covers the daily synchronization path only. Runner execution,
rotation, and data-classification routing remain covered by their existing code
paths and RDRs.

The OpenRouter ZDR endpoint catalog is a sibling synchronization path in this
segment. It is deliberately persisted separately from the free catalog: ZDR
eligibility comes only from OpenRouter's endpoint response and may include paid
models. A failed ZDR refresh never deactivates or rewrites free rows.

## Goals

- Pull OpenRouter's model catalog from `GET /api/v1/models`.
- Persist only fully free models into `LlmModel` with
  `catalog_source: "openrouter_sync"` and `pricing_tier: "free"`.
- Derive capability score and tier mechanically from stable model metadata so
  the existing model-selection and tier-based runner code can reuse the synced
  catalog without bespoke branches.
- Preserve weak-quality models in the catalog, but mark them so default runner
  selection can avoid them.
- Keep the sync idempotent and mark no-longer-listed synced models inactive.

## Design

### `FreeModels::Client`

The client is a thin HTTP wrapper around OpenRouter's models endpoint. It:

- performs a single `GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`
- applies explicit open/read timeouts
- parses the JSON payload
- returns the `data` array as an array of hashes
- raises typed errors for transport failures, timeouts, invalid JSON, and
  unexpected response statuses

The client stays mechanical: no filtering or catalog decisions happen here.

### `FreeModels::Classify`

Classification is a deterministic heuristic that turns API metadata into
Paid-native `capability_score` and `tier` values:

- base score `3.0`
- context window bonuses for `128K+`, `256K+`, and `1M+`
- tool support bonus
- reasoning support bonus
- output-token bonuses
- multimodal bonus when image/video input is supported

The tier mapping is:

- `high` when score `>= 8`
- `mid` when score `>= 6`
- `low` otherwise

### `FreeModels::QualityFilter`

The quality filter is a constant policy surface, not a separate persistence
concept. Models remain in the catalog, but the sync writes
`metadata["below_quality_bar"] = true` when they fail the current minimum:

- context window at least `128_000`
- tool support required

### `FreeModels::Sync`

The sync service:

1. fetches model payloads through `FreeModels::Client`
2. filters to models whose prompt and completion pricing are both `"0"`
3. upserts `LlmModel` rows keyed by `model_id`
4. writes the full upstream payload into `metadata`, merged with local markers
   such as `below_quality_bar`
5. links `free_variant_of_id` by stripping a trailing `:free` suffix and looking
   up the paid row by `model_id`
6. deactivates previously synced rows that were not present in the latest free
   result set
7. logs a structured sync summary

The sync owns only rows with `catalog_source: "openrouter_sync"`. It must never
mutate unrelated seeded or manual catalog entries.

### `FreeModels::SyncJob`

The job is a daily GoodJob cron entry. It:

- runs on the maintenance queue
- enforces single-flight concurrency
- delegates its business work entirely to `FreeModels::Sync`

### OpenRouter ZDR endpoint catalog

`OpenrouterZdr::Client` fetches `/api/v1/endpoints/zdr` and validates the
endpoint-level `model_id` and `name` fields. `OpenrouterZdr::Sync` replaces the
endpoint snapshot transactionally, creates missing `LlmModel` metadata rows
under `catalog_source: "openrouter_zdr_sync"`, and records a singleton sync
state. A model is eligible when at least one endpoint row exists; pricing,
vendor, and provider-wide policy are not eligibility inputs.

The sync state distinguishes an available successful empty snapshot from an
unavailable failed refresh. Unavailability preserves the endpoint snapshot
and exposes its error and last successful timestamp through
`OpenrouterZdr::Catalog`. Successful refreshes remove withdrawn endpoint rows.
Runner setup consumes the same active catalog rows and keeps existing runner
compatibility and project-provider restrictions in the query path. Request-time
`provider.zdr` enforcement remains authoritative.

## Trace Notes

- The provider stored on synced free rows is the upstream model-id prefix (for
  example `deepseek` from `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash:free`), not `"openrouter"`.
- Catalog queries that mean “OpenRouter-synced free models” must therefore key
  off `catalog_source: "openrouter_sync"` plus `pricing_tier: "free"`, not a
  hard-coded provider string.
